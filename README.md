This repository is follows the tutorial outlined by Jason Brownlee in https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/. 

The objective is to develop a Neural Network model to the pollution levels in Beijing from 2010 to 2015. This code differs from the tutorial by organizing it in an object oriented fashion with the Extract, Transform and Load modules cleaning the data, preparing it for ingest by a machine learning algorithm, before training a model and evaluating the resulting predictions.
